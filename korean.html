                    <p>Queen's University has allowed me to pursue a unique degree that could satisfy both my interests in engineering and mathematics. Through the Applied Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering program, I was able to learn high-level mathematical concepts and solve open-ended problems through critical and creative thinking. This program has not only enhanced my problem solving and analytical skills, but also let me improve on my teamwork and communication skills. 
                        <br><br>
                    The rigorous courseload that this program offers has inspired me to pursue mechanical engineering or data science. Through courses such as Machine Design I, Kinematics, Dynamics, and Vibrations, I got the opportunity to understand and design mechanical systems. Math courses like Real Analysis, Algebraic Structures, and Functions of a Complex Variable, has challenged me to understand abstract theories and concepts. My interests in data analysis grew due to courses like Probability I and Management of Experimental Data. Finally, design courses and mechanical engineering labs has given me the opportunity to apply and analyze the theories that were learned in class.</p>

                    <p>Webber Academy, one of the highest ranked high schools in Alberta, has inspired me to pursue engineering and mathematics. The tight-knit community allowed me to develop a strong relationship with my peers and my teachers. Furthermore, the smaller community increased my engagement in the classroom, expecially in STEM courses. Webber Academy was also where I instilled a team-oriented mindset and developed my leadership capabilities as the captain of the basketball team. I was also able to be part of a team that raised over $40,000 for the Terry Fox Foundation.</p>

                                The app consisted of four main sections: Resources, Scenarios, Consent, and Direct Questions. The Resources section was designed to provide the users with several helplines and sources to those in need. The Scenarios section is a quiz section that places the user in an observer's point of view where they witness an event taking place. The user would then choose an action they might take in order to help the victim. The Direct Questions section leads the user through a specific set of events that might have occurred to them. As the user specifies the situation more, the app will guide them to a resource that is suited for their circumstances. Finally, the Consent section provides general information regarding consent and the laws surrounding it.</p>
