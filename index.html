                    <p>Queen's University has allowed me to pursue a unique degree that could satisfy both my interests in engineering and mathematics. Through the Applied Mathematics and Mechanical Engineering program, I was able to learn high-level mathematical concepts and also solve open-ended problems through critical and creative thinking. This program has not only enhanced my problem solving and analytical skills, but also helped me improve on my teamwork and communication skills. 
                        <br><br>
                    The rigorous courseload that this program offers has inspired me to pursue mechanical engineering or data science. Through courses such as Machine Design I, Kinematics, Dynamics, and Vibrations, I got the opportunity to understand and design mechanical systems. Math courses like Real Analysis, Algebraic Structures, and Functions of a Complex Variable, have challenged me to understand abstract theories and concepts. My interests in data analysis grew due to courses like Probability I and Management of Experimental Data. Finally, design courses and mechanical engineering labs have given me the opportunity to apply and analyze the theories that were learned in class.</p>

                    <p>Webber Academy, one of the highest ranked high schools in Alberta, inspired me to pursue engineering and mathematics. The tight-knit community allowed me to develop a strong relationship with my peers and teachers. Furthermore, the smaller community increased my engagement in the classroom, expecially in STEM courses. Webber Academy was also where I developed a team-oriented mindset and leadership capabilities as the captain of the basketball team. I was also able to be part of a team that raised over $40,000 for the Terry Fox Foundation.</p>

The user would then choose an action they might take in order to help the victim. The Direct Questions section leads the user through a specific set of events that might have occurred to them and ultimately guide them to a resource that is suited for their circumstances.
